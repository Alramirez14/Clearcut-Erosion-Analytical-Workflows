# Saving Salmon - Clear Cutting Impacts for Oregonâ€™s Favorite Fish

This is the repository for the clear-cutting erosion impact on Coho Salmon in Oregon's Coast Range. This is where all the data, code, and literature (when applicable) will be housed for the duration of the project. 

In Oregon's Coast Range, timber harvest is the dominant industry and causes severe erosion damage to high-slope forested areas. Within this region, a threatened stock of Coho Salmon spawn in streams that have been historically damaged by timber harvesting from practices like splash damming and log drives. In their current state, these streams are dominated by intermittent stretches of scoured bedrock channel bottoms and sediment-inundated spawning areas.

Since the late 20th century, clear cutting has been restricted on public land (i.e. U.S. Forest Service, BLM) but is still practiced in private timber stands. Downstream impacts from the clear cutting of high slope, sandy landscapes on private timber stands have the potential to destroy remaining critical salmon spawning habitat, even crossing public/private land boundaries.

The goal of this project would be to:
  * Use geospatial data, primarily DTM (digital terrain model) and canopy cover data, over a suitable time series
  * Quantify post-clear-cut erosion and proximity to spawning habitat
  * Produce a white paper urging federal land managers to restrict upstream timber harvesting in areas supporting critical spawning habitat

# Model Implementation

Within this repository, the folder titled ***Clearcut_RUSLE_Model*** contains all necessary code to run the model for your AOIs of choice. Please see instructions within this folder for specifics.
