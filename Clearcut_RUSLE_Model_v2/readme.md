## Implementing the RUSLE model

### Data Preparation
Use the Data_prep.R script to prepare a directory to run the RUSLE model. You will need:
-Study Site Polygon
-Annual NDVI Images over Study Period
-Annual Precipitation Rasters over Study Period
-A Digital Elevation Model
-K Factor Raster

### Running the Model
Use the Clearcut_RUSLE.R script to run the model and save outputs as a .csv file

### Built-in Vizualization
The RUSLE_viz.R will create a variety of figures for data visualization. This will
run from the project directory with no need for modification. Some examples are available in 
the "Results" subdirectory of this repository.

***The results of running the model are present in this directory as well***
